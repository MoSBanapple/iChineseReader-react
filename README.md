# Current issues

* Avatar retrieval from https://ichinesereader.com/storage/avatar does not work. If you solve this, please implement the avatar into avatarModule.js. Retrieval works when pinging from a http tester online, so I don't know why it isn't working here.

* Audio recording on book page (bookContainer.js) is not yet implemented.

* User is unable to add book to folder from book page.

* Badge has not been added to profile page, nor badge login to the login page.

* Visuals could use work - improve where you can.

* Sometimes text in books can be improperly formatted due to how books are implemented. If you can find a way to implement the reader using content.html or index.html directly, do that.

* Bookmarks break when more than one is made on the same book. This is a back-end error, not front-end.

* Text/reading speeds have not yet been implemented.
